# Tether Radar 2.4GHz

Intended for use on DFRobot SEN0306 radar module.

## Single Target mode
This works quite reliably, especially for solid (non-human) objects and surfaces.


## Multi Target mode
Works fairly well but again tends to pick up big solid (radio-reflective) surfaces rather than human beings.
