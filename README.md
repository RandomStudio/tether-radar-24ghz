# Tether Radar 2.4GHz

Intended for use on DFRobot SEN0306 radar module.

## Single Target mode
This works quite reliably, especially for solid (non-human) objects and surfaces.

Works when sending Tether data, too.

## Multi Target mode
This works reliably over serial only. For some reason data is corrupted when attempting to send using Tether (even the serial data gets corrupted).
